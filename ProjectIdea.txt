                                          NITK SOCIAL HUB


The NITK SOCIAL HUB is a website exclusively for the students currently studying at NITK where 
they could connect easily with their fellow NITKians and have an authentic network of students studying 
in NITK. In the website they can post and view each other's profiles and share their progress and projects 
they have worked on with each other so that others could also get some inspiration and motivation.In a 
nutshell, the methodology for developing the NITK SOCIAL HUB used in this project is the agile 
development cycle. The agile development cycle consists of six phases, which is requirements analysis, 
planning, design, implementation or development, testing, and deployment. Due to the iterative and 
flexible nature of this approach, it is able to effectively adapt to users with changing requirements.
